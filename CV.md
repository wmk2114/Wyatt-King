While working with PEN's Digital Safety team, I researched ways for journalists and writers to protect themselves against harassment, threats, and other forms of intimidation.

Videos I produced, wrote, and edited have been viewed over one million times across Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, and my reporting was cited in national media outlets, including the Huffington Post, Al Jazeera, and the New York Times.<br><br>
**William Pitt Sotheby’s International Realty**<br>

Using data that I retrieved from the Multiple Listings Service, public tax records, and web scraping, I created databases for real estate agents that bolstered their ability to advertise properties, evaluate local markets, and understand how well they retained clients.<br><br>
